abstract = {Scanning magnetometers are increasingly used to characterize the magnetization of mineral grains in rock samples. Up-scaling this measurement technique to large numbers of individual particles is hampered by the intrinsic non-uniqueness of potential-field inversion. Here it is shown that this problem can be circumvented by adding tomographic information that determines the location of the possible field sources. Standard potential theory is used to prove a uniqueness theorem that completely characterizes the mathematical background of the corresponding source-localized inversion. It exactly resolves under which conditions a potential-field measurement on a surface can be uniquely decomposed into signals from the different source regions. The intrinsic non-uniqueness of potential-field inversion prevents that the source distribution inside the tomographically outlined regions can be recovered, but the potential field of each region is uniquely defined. For scanning magnetometers in rock magnetism, this result implies that magnetic dipole vectors of large numbers of individual magnetic particles can be reliably reconstructed from surface scans of the magnetic field, if the particle positions are independently determined. This provides an incentive to improve scanning methods for future palaeomagnetic applications.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the past behavior of the geomagnetic field arises from magnetic signals stored in geological materials, e.g., (volcanic) rocks. Bulk rock samples, however, often contain magnetic grains that differ in chemistry, size, and shape; some of them record the Earth's magnetic field well, others are unreliable. The presence of a small amount of adverse behaved magnetic grains in a sample may already obscure important information on the past state of the geomagnetic field. Recently it was shown that it is possible to determine magnetizations of individual grains in a sample by combining X-ray computed tomography and magnetic surface scanning measurements. Here we establish this new Micromagnetic Tomography (MMT) technique and make it suitable for use with different magnetic scanning techniques, and for both synthetic and natural samples. We acquired reliable magnetic directions by selecting subsets of grains in a synthetic sample, and we obtained rock-magnetic information of individual grains in a volcanic sample. This illustrates that MMT opens up entirely new venues of paleomagnetic and rock-magnetic research. MMT's unique ability to determine the magnetization of individual grains in a nondestructive way allows for a systematic analysis of how geological materials record and retain information on the past state of the Earth's magnetic field. Moreover, by interpreting only the contributions of known magnetically well-behaved grains in a sample, MMT has the potential to unlock paleomagnetic information from even the most complex, crucial, or valuable recorders that current methods are unable to recover.},

Here we present the first highly resolved quantitative X-ray ptychographic tomography of an extended object yielding 16 nm isotropic 3D resolution recorded at 2 {\AA} wavelength.

The 1.88 Ga Gunflint biota is a Precambrian microfossil assemblage with different types and qualities of preservation across its numerous geological localities and provides important insights into the Proterozoic biosphere and taphonomic processes. Here we use synchrotron-based ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to investigate well-preserved carbonaceous microfossils from the Schreiber Beach locality as well as poorly-preserved, iron-replaced fossil filaments from the Mink Mountain locality, Gunflint Formation. 3D nanoscale imaging with contrast based on electron density allowed us to assess the morphology and carbonaceous composition of different specimens and identify the minerals associated with their preservation based on retrieved mass densities. In the Mink Mountain filaments, the identification of mature kerogen and maghemite rather than the ubiquitously described hematite indicates an influence from biogenic organics on the local maturation of iron oxides through diagenesis. This non-destructive 3D approach to microfossil composition at the nanoscale within their geological context represents a powerful approach to assess the taphonomy and biogenicity of challenging or poorly preserved traces of early microbial life, and may be applied effectively to extraterrestrial samples returned from upcoming space missions.},

abstract = {The geochemical analysis of trace elements in rutile (e.g., Pb, U, and Zr) is routinely used to extract information on the nature and timing of geological events. However, the mobility of trace elements can affect age and temperature determinations, with the controlling mecha-nisms for mobility still debated. To further this debate, we use laser-ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry and atom probe tomography to characterize the micro- to nanoscale distribution of trace elements in rutile sourced from the Capricorn orogen, Western Australia. At the >20 pm scale, there is no significant trace-element variation in single grains, and a concordant U-Pb crystallization age of 1872 ± 6 Ma (2a) shows no evidence of isotopic disturbance. At the nanoscale, clusters as much as 20 nm in size and enriched in trace ele-ments (Al, Cr, Pb, and V) are observed. The 207Pb/206Pb ratio of 0.176 ± 0.040 (2a) obtained from clusters indicates that they formed after crystallization, potentially during regional metamorphism. We interpret the clusters to have formed by the entrapment of mobile trace elements in transient sites of radiation damage during upper amphibolite facies metamor-phism. The entrapment would affect the activation energy for volume diffusion of elements present in the cluster. The low number and density of clusters provides constraints on the time over which clusters formed, indicating that peak metamorphic temperatures are short-lived, <10 m.y. events. Our results indicate that the use of trace elements to estimate volume diffusion in rutile is more complex than assuming a homogeneous medium.},

abstract = {In-situ monazite Th-U-total Pb dating and zircon LA-ICP-MS depth-profiling was applied to metasedimentary rocks from the Vaimok Lens in the Seve Nappe Complex (SNC), Scandinavian Caledonides. Results of monazite Th-U-total Pb dating , coupled with major and trace element mapping of monazite, revealed 603 ± 16 Ma Neoproterozoic cores surrounded by rims that formed at 498 ± 10 Ma. Monazite rim formation was facilitated via dissolution-reprecipitation of Neoproterozoic monazite. The monazite rims record garnet growth as they are depleted in Y 2 O 3 with respect to the Neoproterozoic cores. Rims are also characterized by relatively high SrO with respect to the cores. Results of the zircon depth-profiling revealed igneous zircon cores with crystallization ages typical for SNC metasediments. Multiple zircon grains also exhibit rims formed by dissolution-reprecipitation that are defined by enrichment of light rare earth elements, U, Th, P, ± Y, and ± Sr. Rims also have subdued Eu anomalies (Eu/Eu* ≈ 0.6-1.2) with respect to the cores. The age of zircon rim formation was calculated from three metasedimentary rocks: 480 ± 22 Ma; 475 ± 26 Ma; and 479 ± 38 Ma. These results show that both monazite and zircon experienced dissolution-reprecipitation under high-pressure conditions. Caledonian monazite formed coeval with garnet growth during subduction of the Vaimok Lens, whereas zircon rim formation coincided with monazite breakdown to apatite, allanite and clinozoisite during initial exhumation.},

abstract = {Despite their importance in constraining the dynamics of Gondwana's final phase of assembly, Cambrian paleomagnetic data from Gondwana are sparse. The Cambrian paleomagnetic dataset of Western Gondwana is especially poor, being defined by only a handful of poles. Here we contribute new Furongian paleomagnetic data from the $\sim$500 Ma post-collisional, Santa Angelica and Venda Nova plutons from the southern portion of the Ara{\c{c}}ua{\'{i}} orogen in SE Brazil. The characteristic magnetization isolated from both plutons reveals two groups of directions that are demonstrated to be antipodal. On the basis of a thermal diffusion model, we attribute these antipodal directions to primary thermoremanent magnetizations acquired by cooling of the plutons in the presence of a reversing field. Together, paleomagnetic results from 35 sites distributed between the two plutons allows computation of a new $\sim$500 Ma paleopole: 4.7° N, 332.2° E, A95 = 4.06 and K = 68.82. This pole does not resemble any younger paleomagnetic poles either from Gondwana or the independent South American plate after the demise of Pangea, but instead closely corresponds to the Miaolingian and Furongian sector of reference apparent polar wander paths for Gondwana. It also agrees well with the limited existing individual early Paleozoic poles from Western Gondwana. Our new result may thus be regarded as a reference pole for Western Gondwana in Furongian time. Considerations of the Cambrian paleomagnetic data from Eastern and Western Gondwana suggest that while the supercontinent was amalgamated by $\sim$500 Ma, there was likely significant motion between Eastern and Western Gondwana in earlier Cambrian time.},

abstract = {We have developed a fast total-field anomaly inversion to estimate the magnetization direction of multiple sources with approximately spherical shapes and known centres. Our method is an overdetermined inverse problem that can be applied to interpret multiple sources with different but homogeneous magnetization directions. It requires neither the prior computation of any transformation-like reduction to the pole nor the use of regularly spaced data on a horizontal grid. The method contains flexibility to be implemented as a linear or non-linear inverse problem, which results, respectively, in a least-squares or robust estimate of the components of the magnetization vector of the sources. Applications to synthetic data show the robustness of our method against interfering anomalies and errors in the location of the sources' centre. Besides, we show the feasibility of applying the upward continuation to interpret non-spherical sources. Applications to field data over the Goi{\'{a}}s alkaline province (GAP), Brazil, show the good performance of our method in estimating geologically meaningful magnetization directions. The results obtained for a region of the GAP, near to the alkaline complex of Diorama, suggest the presence of non-outcropping sources marked by strong remanent magnetization with inclination and declination close to g'70.35 and g'19.81°, respectively. This estimated magnetization direction leads to predominantly positive reduced-to-the-pole anomalies, even for other region of the GAP, in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goi{\'{a}}s. These results show that the non-outcropping sources near to the alkaline complex of Diorama have almost the same magnetization direction of those ones in the alkaline complex of Montes Claros de Goi{\'{a}}s, strongly suggesting that these sources have been emplaced in the crust within almost the same geological time interval.},

abstract = {Recently developed scanning magnetic microscopes measure the magnetic field in a plane above a thin-plate magnetization distribution. These instruments have broad applications in geoscience and materials science, but are limited by the requirement that the sample magnetization must be retrieved from measured field data, which is a generically nonunique inverse problem. This problem leads to an analysis of the kernel of the related magnetization operators, which also has relevance to the 'equivalent source problem' in the case of measurements taken from just one side of the magnetization. We characterize the kernel of the operator relating planar magnetization distributions to planar magnetic field maps in various function and distribution spaces (e.g., sums of derivatives of Lp (Lebesgue spaces) or bounded mean oscillation (BMO) functions). For this purpose, we present a generalization of the Hodge decomposition in terms of Riesz transforms and utilize it to characterize sources that do not produce a magnetic field either above or below the sample, or that are magnetically silent (i.e. no magnetic field anywhere outside the sample). For example, we show that a thin-plate magnetization is silent (i.e. in the kernel) when its normal component is zero and its tangential component is divergence free. In addition, we show that compactly supported magnetizations (i.e. magnetizations that are zero outside of a bounded set in the source plane) that do not produce magnetic fields either above or below the sample are necessarily silent. In particular, neither a nontrivial planar magnetization with fixed direction (unidimensional) compact support nor a bidimensional planar magnetization (i.e. a sum of two unidimensional magnetizations) that is nontangential can be silent. We prove that any planar magnetization distribution is equivalent to a unidimensional one. We also discuss the advantages of mapping the field on both sides of a magnetization, whenever experimentally feasible. Examples of source recovery are given along with a brief discussion of the Fourier-based inversion techniques that are utilized. {\textcopyright} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

On the other hand, in the central part of the anomaly, the x- and y-coordinate estimates are very close to the respective source horizontal coordinates regardless of the true or presumed structural indices and regardless of the magnetization inclination and declination. This contrasting behavior of the horizontal coordinate estimates may be used to automatically delineate the region associated with the best solutions.

abstract = {We have developed a new method that drastically reduces the number of the source location estimates in Euler deconvolution to only one per anomaly. Our method employs the analytical estimators of the base level and of the horizontal and vertical source positions in Euler deconvolution as a function of the x- and y-coordinates of the observations. By assuming any tentative structural index (defining the geometry of the sources), our method automatically locates plateaus, on the maps of the horizontal coordinate estimates, indicating consistent estimates that are very close to the true corresponding coordinates. These plateaus are located in the neighborhood of the highest values of the anomaly and show a contrasting behavior with those estimates that form inclined planes at the anomaly borders. The plateaus are automatically located on the maps of the horizontal coordinate estimates by fitting a first-degree polynomial to these estimates in a moving-window scheme spanning all estimates. The positions where the angular coefficient estimates are closest to zero identify the plateaus of the horizontal coordinate estimates. The sample means of these horizontal coordinate estimates are the best horizontal location estimates. After mapping each plateau, our method takes as the best structural index the one that yields the minimum correlation between the total-field anomaly and the estimated base level over each plateau. By using the estimated structural index for each plateau, our approach extracts the vertical coordinate estimates over the corresponding plateau. The sample means of these estimates are the best depth location estimates in our method. When applied to synthetic data, our method yielded good results if the bodies produce weak- and mid-interfering anomalies.

The reconstruction of salt bodies from gravity data usually uses interactive forward modelling but recently gravity inversion methods have been developed to interpret this kind of geologic environment.

The technique is based upon Euler's homogeneity relationship (hence, the acronym EULDPH) and differs from similar techniques which are currently available in that no basic geologic model is assumed. Therefore, EULDPH can be applied in a wider variety of geologic situations than can model-dependent techniques. The price paid for this increased flexibility is a heavier burden on the interpreter. Successful interpretation of EULDPH results is partially dependent upon the interpreter's intuitive understanding of the concept of the equivalent stratum and also partially dependent upon experience with model studies.

abstract = {Scanning magnetic microscopes are being increasingly utilized in paleomagnetic studies of geological samples. These instruments typically map a single component of the sample's magnetic field at close proximity with submillimeter horizontal spatial resolution. However, in most applications, an image of the magnetization distribution within the sample is desired rather than its external magnetic field. This requires carefully solving an ill-posed inverse problem to obtain solutions that are nearly free of artifacts and consistent with both natural and laboratory magnetization processes. We present a new, fast inversion technique based on classic methods developed for the Fourier domain that retrieves planar unidirectional magnetization distributions from magnetic field maps. Whereas our approach considers the subtle peculiarities of scanning magnetic microscopy which otherwise can complicate this technique, much of the formalism and algorithms described in this work can also be directly applied to province-scale magnetic field data from aeromagnetic surveys and may be used as an initial step in the modeling of magnetic sources with complex three-dimensional geometries. We discuss sources of inaccuracy observed in practical implementations of the technique and present strategies to improve the quality of inversions. Numerous examples of inversion of both synthetic and experimental data demonstrate the performance of the technique under different conditions. In particular, we retrieve magnetization distributions of a Hawaiian basalt and compare it to inversions calculated in a previous work. We conclude by showing a reconstructed magnetization for the eucrite meteorite ALHA81001 that displays in high resolution the spatial distribution of high-coercivity grains within the sample. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Remanent magnetization in geological samples may record the past intensity and direction of planetary magnetic fields. Traditionally, this magnetization is analyzed through measurements of the net magnetic moment of bulk millimeter to centimeter sized samples. However, geological samples are often mineralogically and texturally heterogeneous at submillimeter scales, with only a fraction of the ferromagnetic grains carrying the remanent magnetization of interest. Therefore, characterizing this magnetization in such cases requires a technique capable of imaging magnetic fields at fine spatial scales and with high sensitivity. To address this challenge, we developed a new instrument, based on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, which enables direct imaging of magnetic fields due to both remanent and induced magnetization, as well as optical imaging, of room-temperature geological samples with spatial resolution approaching the optical diffraction limit. We describe the operating principles of this device, which we call the quantum diamond microscope (QDM), and report its optimized image-area-normalized magnetic field sensitivity (20 µT⋅µm/Hz1/2), spatial resolution (5 µm), and field of view (4 mm), as well as trade-offs between these parameters. We also perform an absolute magnetic field calibration for the device in different modes of operation, including three-axis (vector) and single-axis (projective) magnetic field imaging. Finally, we use the QDM to obtain magnetic images of several terrestrial and meteoritic rock samples, demonstrating its ability to resolve spatially distinct populations of ferromagnetic carriers.},

As a result, our understanding of bulk rock magnetization is limited, specifically for the case of multi-domain minerals. In this work, we use a newly developed nitrogen-vacancy magnetic microscope, capable of quantitative vectorial magnetic imaging with optical resolution. We demonstrate direct imaging of the vectorial magnetic field of a single, multi-domain dendritic magnetite, as well as the measurement and calculation of the weak magnetic moments of an individual grain on the micron scale.

abstract = {Recent paleomagnetic studies of two Main Group pallasites, the Imilac and Esquel, have found evidence for a strong, late-stage magnetic field on the parent body. It has been hypothesized that this magnetic field was generated by a core dynamo, driven by compositional convection during core solidification. Cooling models suggest that the onset of core solidification occurred $\sim$200 Ma after planetary accretion. Prior to core solidification, a core dynamo may have been generated by thermal convection; however a thermal dynamo is predicted to be short-lived, with a duration of $\sim$10 Ma to $\sim$40 Ma after planetary accretion. These models predict, therefore, a period of quiescence between the thermally driven dynamo and the compositionally driven dynamo, when no core dynamo should be active. To test this hypothesis, we have measured the magnetic remanence recorded by the Marjalahti and Brenham pallasites, which based on cooling-rate data locked in any magnetic field signals present $\sim$95 Ma to $\sim$135 Ma after planetary accretion, before core solidification began. The cloudy zone, a region of nanoscale tetrataenite islands within a Fe-rich matrix was imaged using X-ray photoemission electron microscopy. The recovered distribution of magnetisation within the cloudy zone suggests that the Marjalahti and Brenham experienced a very weak magnetic field, which may have been induced by a crustal remanence, consistent with the predicted lack of an active core dynamo at this time. We show that the transition from a quiescent period to an active, compositionally driven dynamo has a distinctive paleomagnetic signature, which may be a crucial tool for constraining the time of core solidification on differentiated bodies, including Earth.},

abstract = {Scanning magnetic microscopy is a new methodology for mapping magnetic fields with high spatial resolution and field sensitivity. An important goal has been to develop high-performance instruments that do not require cryogenic technology due to its high cost, complexity, and limitation on sensor-to-sample distance. Here we report the development of a low-cost scanning magnetic microscope based on commercial room-temperature magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) sensors that typically achieves spatial resolution better than 7 $\mu$m. By comparing different bias and detection schemes, optimal performance was obtained when biasing the MTJ sensor with a modulated current at 1.0 kHz in a Wheatstone bridge configuration while using a lock-in amplifier in conjunction with a low-noise custom-made preamplifier. A precision horizontal (x-y) scanning stage comprising two coupled nanopositioners controls the position of the sample and a linear actuator adjusts the sensor-to-sample distance. We obtained magnetic field sensitivities better than 150 nT/Hz1/2between 0.1 and 10 Hz, which is a critical frequency range for scanning magnetic microscopy. This corresponds to a magnetic moment sensitivity of 10-14A m2,a factor of 100 better than achievable with typical commercial superconducting moment magnetometers. Italso represents an improvement in sensitivity by a factor between 10 and 30 compared to similar scanning MTJ microscopes based on conventional bias-detection schemes. To demonstrate the capabilities of the instrument, two polished thin sectionsof representative geological samples were scanned along with a synthetic sample containing magnetic microparticles. The instrument is usable for a diversity of applications that require mapping of samples at room temperature to preserve magnetic properties or viability, including paleomagnetism and rock magnetism, nondestructive evaluation of materials, and biological assays.},

Unlike standard rock magnetometers, SQUID microscopes map magnetic fields rather than measuring magnetic moments such that the sample magnetization pattern must be retrieved from source model fits to the measured field data. Here we present the first direct comparison between paleornapetic analyses on natural samples using joint measurements from SQUID microscopy and moment magnetometry. We demonstrate that in combination with a priori geologic and petrographic data, SQUID microscopy can accurately characterize the magnetization of lunar glass spherules and Hawaiian basalt. The bulk moment magnitude and direction of these samples inferred from inversions of SQUID microscopy data match direct measurements on the same samples using moment mapetometry. In addition, these inversions provide unique constraints on the magnetization distribution within the sample. These measurements are among the most sensitive and highest resolution quantitative paleomapetic studies of natural remanent magnetization to date.

Several results derived from both synthetic and experimental data are presented. In particular, practical cases are shown where vector maps can assist the analysis of magnetic properties of geological samples.

The heating of samples in most methods induces magnetic alteration-a process that is still poorly understood, but prevents obtaining correct field values. Here we show induced changes in magnetic domain state directly by imaging the domain configurations of titanomagnetite particles in samples that systematically fail to produce truthful estimates. Magnetic force microscope images were taken before and after a heating step typically used in absolute palaeointensity experiments. For a critical temperature (250, we observe major changes: distinct, blocky domains before heating change into curvier, wavy domains thereafter. These structures appeared unstable over time: after 1-year of storage in a magnetic-field-free environment, the domain states evolved into a viscous remanent magnetization state. Our observations qualitatively explain reported underestimates from otherwise (technically) successful experiments and therefore have major implications for all palaeointensity methods involving heating. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited .},

abstract = {The memoir is devoted to a brief theoretical study of the most typical magnetic properties of rocks. In particular {\S}{\S} 3–16 are on ferrimagnetism, {\S}{\S} 17–35 on single domain particles and {\S}{\S} 36–57 on large multi-domain particles.Theoretical studies are made of the following aspects of the subject and compared with the experimental results: remanent magnetization ({\S} 38), initial susceptibility ({\S} 39), variation with applied field of thermoremanent magnetization (abbreviated to T.R.M.) ({\S}{\S} 40, 41, 57), the ratio Qk of T.R.M. acquired in a given field to the induced magnetization in the same field ({\S} 42), the additivity of partial T.R.M.'s in the case both of small grains ({\S} 28) and large grains ({\S} 57).Considerable space is devoted to the magnetic ‘viscosity' due to thermal agitation in small grains ({\S}{\S} 24–27) and in larger ones ({\S}{\S} 49–56). Expressions are given for magnetic ‘viscosity' in the range of Rayleigh's relations ({\S} 51) particularly with a demagnetizing field present ({\S} 54). The theoretical and experimental results on the irreversible decrease in isothermal remanent magnetization are briefly quoted both for small ({\S} 30) and large ({\S} 55) grains. Different reversing mechanisms are reviewed which could cause a negative T.R.M., that is one directed in the opposite sense to the field applied during cooling. Some are related to negative Weiss-Heisenberg exchange forces: reversal by diffusion involving ionic exchange between the two sub-lattices in a ferrimagnetic ({\S} 7), reversal by anomalous thermal variation is spontaneous magnetization ({\S}{\S} 11, 12), reversal by diffusion with complete change of composition ({\S} 16). The others are effects of the demagnetizing field: reversal in mixtures of two constituents with different Curie Points ({\S}{\S} 31–34), reversal by segregation, allotropy and chemical alteration ({\S} 35). The actual examples so far known are recalled. {\textcopyright} 1955 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Synchrotron radiation X-ray tomographic microscopy is a nondestructive method providing ultra-high-resolution 3D digital images of rock microstructures. We describe this method and, to demonstrate its wide applicability, we present 3D images of very different rock types: Berea sandstone, Fontainebleau sandstone, dolomite, calcitic dolomite, and three-phase magmatic glasses. For some samples, full and partial saturation scenarios are considered using oil, water, and air. The rock images precisely reveal the 3D rock microstructure, the pore space morphology, and the interfaces between fluids saturating the same pore. We provide the raw image data sets as online supplementary material, along with laboratory data describing the rock properties. By making these data sets available to other research groups, we aim to stimulate work based on digital rock images of high quality and high resolution. We also discuss and suggest possible applications and research directions that can be pursued on the basis of our data. {\textcopyright} 2013 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.},

Starting from atomic magnetism and magnetostatic principles, the authors explain why domains and micromagnetic structures form in ferromagnetic crystals and how these lead to magnetic memory in the form of thermal, chemical and other remanent magnetizations. The phenomenal stability of these magnetizations, providing a record of plate tectonic motions over millions of years, is explained by thermal activation theory. One chapter is devoted to practical tests of domain state and paleomagnetic stability; another deals with pseudo-single-domain magnetism. The final four chapters place magnetism in the context of igneous, sedimentary, metamorphic, and extraterrestrial rocks. This book will be of great value to graduate students and researchers in geophysics and geology, particularly in paleomagnetism and rock magnetism, as well as physicists and electrical engineers interested in fine-particle magnetism and magnetic recording.},

abstract = {The magnetic method, perhaps the oldest of geophysical exploration techniques, blossomed after the advent of airborne surveys in World War II. With improvements in instrumentation, navigation, and platform compensation, it is now possible to map the entire crustal section at a variety of scales, from strongly magnetic basement at regional scale to weakly magnetic sedimentary contacts at local scale. Methods of data filtering, display, and interpretation have also advanced, especially with the availability of low-cost, high-performance personal computers and color raster graphics. The magnetic method is the primary exploration tool in the search for minerals. In other arenas, the magnetic method has evolved from its sole use for mapping basement structure to include a wide range of new applications, such as locating intrasedimentary faults, defining subtle lithologic contacts, mapping salt domes in weakly magnetic sediments, and better defining targets through 3D inversion. These new applications have increased the method's utility in all realms of exploration — in the search for minerals, oil and gas, geothermal resources, and groundwater, and for a variety of other purposes such as natural hazards assessment, mapping impact structures, and engineering and environmental studies.},

@article{Fu2020,
abstract = {Interest in magnetic fields on the ancient Earth and other planetary bodies has motivated the paleomagnetic analysis of complex rocks such as meteorites that carry heterogeneous magnetizations at <<1 mm scales. The net magnetic moment of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) in such small samples is often below the detection threshold of common cryogenic magnetometers. The quantum diamond microscope (QDM) is an emerging magnetic imaging technology with $\sim$1 $\mu$m resolution and can, in principle, recover magnetizations as weak as 10−17 Am2. However, the typically 1–100 $\mu$m sample-to-sensor distance of QDM measurements can result in complex (nondipolar) magnetic field maps, from which the net magnetic moment cannot be determined using a simple algorithm. Here we generate synthetic magnetic field maps to quantify the errors introduced by sample nondipolarity and by map processing procedures such as upward continuation. We find that inversions based on least squares dipole fits of upward continued data can recover the net moment of complex samples with <5% to 10% error for maps with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the range typical of current generation QDMs. We validate these error estimates experimentally using comparisons between QDM maps and between QDM and SQUID microscope data, concluding that, within the limitations described here, the QDM is a robust technique for recovering the net magnetic moment of weakly magnetized samples. More sophisticated net moment fitting algorithms in the future can be combined with upward continuation methods described here to improve accuracy.},

abstract = {The constitution of rock and mineral magnetism and its 'applications' or 'connections' are discussed in section 1.3. Some applications depend on the physical models of rock and mineral magnetism, and the extent to which rock and mineral magnetism research has provided experimental support for the models. The models essentially concern the acquisition and rem oval of weak field remanences, and form the physical basis for determinations of the direction and intensity ofthe ancient geomagnetic field, and the inferences which can be made from such adetermination. The models also suggest methods by which the palaeomagnetic signal may be distinguished from 'noise'. The models are applied in geological problems, such as the determination of emplacement temperatures, or in 'magnetic granulometry' with many areas of interest from technology to cosmology. A second species of application is found in the methods and techniques of rock and mineral magnetism, largely the determination of the composition, concentration and microstructure of the magnetic fraction of a rock or artefact. This provides the chemical basis of palaeomagnetism and palaeo-intensity studies, and can be used to monitor changes induced in a rock or artefact during laboratory heating. It also finds application as a tool in petrology, in environmental studies, and in the biologicaljmedical area. The knowledge and experience of rock and mineral magnetism also finds application in a number of other areas which might be grouped together under the heading of 'planetary physics'. They often involve large-scale phenomena, in some cases at remote distances, or the properties of inaccessible materials. Several questions-the properties of the source material contributing to the magnetic field measured at the surface of the Earth or other Earth-type planet, the depth of the Curie point isotherm, the origin of the seismomagnetic and volcanomagnetic effects, the magnetic and magneto-mineralogical effects of meteoritic impact, and the mechanism of magnetiza-tion of the crusts of Earth-type bodies in the solar system-may find some answer in the body of rock and mineral magnetism knowledge.},
