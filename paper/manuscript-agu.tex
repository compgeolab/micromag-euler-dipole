% (A title should be specific, informative, and brief. Use
% abbreviations only if they are defined in the abstract. Titles that
% start with general keywords then specific terms are optimized in
% searches)

% KEY POINTS
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  List up to three key points (at least one is required)
%  Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
%  Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences

% Example:
% \begin{keypoints}
% \item	List up to three key points (at least one is required)
% \item	Key Points summarize the main points and conclusions of the article
% \item	Each must be 140 characters or fewer with no special characters or punctuation and must be complete sentences
% \end{keypoints}

\begin{keypoints}
\item We present a fast algorithm to estimate the position and magnetization of individual sources using only magnetic microscopy data.
\item The algorithm was validated using synthetic samples that included both dipolar and non-dipolar sources with varying depths and intensities.
\item The successful application of the algorithm on a speleothem sample represents an advancement of this methodology for paleomagnetic studies.
\end{keypoints}

%
%  ABSTRACT and PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
%
% A good Abstract will begin with a short description of the problem
% being addressed, briefly describe the new data or analyses, then
% briefly states the main conclusion(s) and how they are supported and
% uncertainties.

% The Plain Language Summary should be written for a broad audience,
% including journalists and the science-interested public, that will not have
% a background in your field.
%
% A Plain Language Summary is required in GRL, JGR: Planets, JGR: Biogeosciences,
% JGR: Oceans, G-Cubed, Reviews of Geophysics, and JAMES.
